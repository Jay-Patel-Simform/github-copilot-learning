Using Tailwind CSS's theme configuration, refactor the code by:

1. Review the provided code and identify all Tailwind utility classes
2. Reference the theme documentation at https://tailwindcss.com/docs/theme
3. Replace direct utility classes with custom theme variables in your ```app/app.css```  file
4. Define appropriate values for:
   - Colors
   - Spacing
   - Typography
   - Breakpoints
   - Other design tokens

5. Update all component styles to use the new theme variables
6. Maintain existing responsive and state variants
7. Verify visual consistency after refactoring

Please provide the code you want to refactor to receive specific guidance on theme implementation.
